# TODO list

Even though this is a functional project, it could be improved in many ways

- Change the DOOM fork to something like GZDoom and...

- ...hook Draw in WndProc to draw over the window instead of using render hooks

- Redo a bunch of the code and make a better API to communicate with the game (such as bringing back SDL)

- FIX RELOADED-II NATIVE HOOKING - we're using Ultimate ASI Loader since it works much more stable than Reloaded-II. This is likely due to DRM or things getting nuked during hooking.
